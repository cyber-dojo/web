Tennis has a rather quirky scoring system, and to newcomers it 
can be a little difficult to keep track of. The local tennis club
has some code that is currently being used to update the scoreboard
when a player scores a point. They has recently acquired two smaller
tennis clubs, and they two each have a similar piece of code.
 
You have just been employed by the tennis club, and your job 
is to refactor all three codebases until you are happy to
work with any of them. The future is uncertain, new features may
be needed, and you want to be thoroughly on top of your game when
that happens.
 
Summary of Tennis scoring:
1. A game is won by the first player to have won at least four points 
   in total and at least two points more than the opponent.
2. The running score of each game is described in a manner peculiar 
   to tennis: scores from zero to three points are described as “love”, 
   “fifteen”, “thirty”, and “forty” respectively.
3. If at least three points have been scored by each player, and the 
   scores are equal, the score is “deuce”.
4. If at least three points have been scored by each side and a player
   has one more point than his opponent, the score of the game is
   “advantage” for the player in the lead.
