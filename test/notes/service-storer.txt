If the katas object (saver/storer) can be decoupled from git it could be a big
win for testing as I could then probably re-instate FakeDisk.
I think there could ultimately be 3 kinds of 'storer' (see below)
But for now the simplest is to simply create one 'storer' than still uses
git and behave exactly the same as the current host_disk_katas.rb except
that each kata has its own volume. This is also the simplest step to
get a converter service running.
A 'converter' service would be given a kata id and would check if this was yet
stored in its own named docker volume. If not it would convert it.
It would then delete the kata from the hard-disk.
Main issue with this is that you cannot now rsync from one server to another.
And this affects backups too.

1. katas_storer
   Holds manifest.json as a direct copy of start-point info
   which it is then decoupled from.

2. avatar_storer
   Holds the sandbox which may hold binary files (.class, .so, etc)
   What the avatar's run-test uses (currently tar-piped in-out)
   This could use one volume per avatar. This means I do not need to
   tar-pipe in/out.
   NB: iterating through all the avatars in a kata needs to happen here.
       Eg suppose I have volumes called
           123456789A_lion
           123456789B_hippo
           123456789A_elephant
       Suppose there are 10000's of avatars across all katas.
       I need an efficient way of finding the avatars in kata
       123456789A are [lion, elephant]
       With docker 1.12 there is a --filter option on [docker volume ls]
       So...
           $ docker volume ls --filter name=^123456789A
   I need to
   o) remove deleted files from the volume
   o) add new/changed files to the volume

3. tag_storer
   Holds increments.json which contains date-time-stamp info
   on each traffic-light.
   Also holds one folder per tag which can contain single json
   file holding
     o) visible_files
     o) output
     o) colour (red/amber/green)
