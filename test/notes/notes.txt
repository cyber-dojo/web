move setting of environment variables inside rails startup code
and out of docker-compose.yml

app/lib/StubRunner
combine test's hex-id with avater.name in tmp folder

storer.each needs to accept first 2 digits and katas.each loops 256 times.

if I do disk[storer.avatar_path(...)] a lot it might be worth adding
storer.avatar_dir(...)

would be better to pass kata.id and avatar.name to runner.run()

cyber-dojo shell script is a bit of a mess.
It's because of three commands
1. cyber-dojo up
2. cyber-dojo down
3. cyber-dojo start-point create name --dir=...

I have been assuming that 1 and 2 require a local docker-compose.yml
file. However, what if there was a web_cli image which held the
docker-compose.yml file (as well as the cyber-dojo.sh file)
I have also been assuming 3 requires access to the local disk.
But that is not necessarily true either. I could volume mount the named
dir into the web_cli container.

Default will be languages.

an output file is actually stored in the sandbox of an avatar.
this is not right. it means the avatar cant create an output file
for itself. The output 'file' should only be in the manifest.

for tests I have to put red_amber_green lambdas (such as bash_unit)
into the output.colour_of. Can this dependency be broken?

lib/unit_test_framework_lookup.rb is used only by tests.
it maps from display_name to unit_test_framework which is then
used to determine output.colour_of method.

Storing the red_amber_green lambda inside the kata's manifest.json
file seems to be essential now that setup start-points can be customized.
However, it creates duplication, and it means that if you find
a fault in the lambda and want to upgrade it, you can't fix it for past katas.
Eg suppose you fork from an existing kata and its unit-test framework has
been upgraded. You cannot edit the lambda.
If could refactor lib/unit_test_framework_lookup.rb so it mapped
from image_name to lamda-src. Then when forking I could see if there was
a (new) master in the lookup.

web_base/Dockerfile still has this line
   && cd ${CYBER_DOJO_HOME} ; bundle install --without development test \

Would be good to have a [cyber-dojo] cli command to export
a specific kata to a given folder. This would make it easier
to create custom exercises. Must not export to default VM
on Mac/Windows quickstart-terminal.

Make [cyber-dojo clean] remove dead containers as well as dead images?

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Note that upgrading Dockerfiles and images might break cyber-dojo.sh
files since paths can be different...
Does the cyber-dojo.sh file belong to the image rather than the start-point?

Occasional test failures (when run locally)...
  ForkerControllerTest#test_'EAE021',
    when language no longer exists, the fork fails, and the reason given is language
  SetupControllerTest#test_'EB77D9',
    show_exercises page uses cached exercises that are runnable

  Tests are defintely not unit-tests and almost certainly have order
  dependencies. State of cache files. How to resolve?

  I could reinstate FakeDisk, leave env-vars for data ROOTs, then
  fill FakeDisk with known content, then do access to dojo methods
  such as dojo.exercises

  For now, deleting caches at start of app_controller tests.

Note: need a check that each docker image has a user in it called nobody
      (I don't think it's uid is important)
