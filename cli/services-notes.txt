Note that once web is split into services I could no longer run cyber-dojo
as a local rails server. I think that's the right thing to do.

If the katas object (saver/storer) can be decoupled from git it could be a big
win for testing as I could then probably re-instate FakeDisk.
I think there are 3 kinds of 'storer'.

1. katas_storer
   Holds manifest.json as a direct copy of start-point info
   which it is then decoupled from.

2. avatar_storer
   Holds the sandbox which may hold binary files (.class, .so, etc)
   What the avatar's run-test uses (currently tar-piped in-out)
   This could use one volume per avatar. This means I do not need to
   tar-pipe in/out.
   NB: iterating through all the avatars in a kata needs to happen here.
       Eg suppose I have volumes called
           123456789A_lion
           123456789B_hippo
           123456789A_elephant
       Suppose there are 10000's of avatars across all katas.
       I need an efficient way of finding the avatars in kata
       123456789A are [lion, elephant]
       With docker 1.12 there is a --filter option on [docker volume ls]
       So...
           $ docker volume ls --filter name=^123456789A
   I need to
   o) remove deleted files from the volume
   o) add new/changed files to the volume

3. tag_storer
   Holds increments.json which contains date-time-stamp info
   on each traffic-light.
   Also holds one folder per tag which can contain single json
   file holding
     o) visible_files
     o) output
     o) colour (red/amber/green)

I would still need a 'converter' service which would be given a kata id
and would check if this was stored in (current) git format on hard-disk.
If it was it would issue all commands necessary to the storers and then
delete the kata from the hard-disk.
It would need
o) katas mounted
o) link to all 3 storers.

downloader could also be a new service...
downloader currently returns a zip file of the whole kata with a git repo
per animal.  To decouple this from git I could return a zip in the tag-storer
format (one subdir per tag).
I could insert a shell script file into this zip which (when run) would convert
the unzipped structure it into the current (git) format (it would also check
that git was installed)
Should this be a new service or in the storer?
