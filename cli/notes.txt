have some way of choosing which setup page gets shown when
you click the [setup a new practice session] button.
Default will be languages.

o) tests for cyber-dojo script

an output file is actually stored in the sandbox of an avatar.
this is not right. it means the avatar cant create an output file
for itself. The output 'file' should only be in the manifest.

Move runners from lib/code to app/lib/code

for tests I have to put red_amber_green lambdas (such as bash_unit)
into the output.colour_of. Can this dependency be broken?

web_base/Dockerfile still has this line
   && cd ${CYBER_DOJO_HOME} ; bundle install --without development test \

Would be good to have a [cyber-dojo] cli command to export
a specific kata to a given folder. This would make it easier
to create custom exercises. Must not export to default VM
on Mac/Windows quickstart-terminal.

Make [cyber-dojo clean] remove dead containers as well as dead images?

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Note that upgrading Dockerfiles and images might break cyber-dojo.sh
files since paths can be different...
Does the cyber-dojo.sh file belong to the image rather than the start-point?

un-hardwire setting of 2 core env-vars in cyber-dojo script.
  export CYBER_DOJO_DATA_ROOT="/home/docker/data"

cyber-dojo.rb failure messages are
FAILED: ....
Check what [docker] does and mimic that.
$ docker images --ssss
flag provided but not defined: --ssss
See 'docker images --help'.
Test these with shunit2 tests.

Occasional test failures (when run locally)...
  ForkerControllerTest#test_'EAE021',
    when language no longer exists, the fork fails, and the reason given is language
  SetupControllerTest#test_'EB77D9',
    show_exercises page uses cached exercises that are runnable

  Tests are defintely not unit-tests and almost certainly have order
  dependencies. State of cache files. How to resolve?

  I could reinstate FakeDisk, leave env-vars for data ROOTs, then
  fill FakeDisk with known content, then do access to dojo methods
  such as dojo.exercises

  For now, deleting caches at start of app_controller tests.

Note: need a check that each docker image has a user in it called nobody
      (I don't think it's uid is important)

get travis to push images to cdf hub?
push images to cyberdojofoundation hub if tests pass

add confirmation diagnostic to each [cyber-dojo] command?
