In the new start-points architecture how do you add a new
output-parse function when installing a new language+test_framework?
Inside the start-point volume add colour_of.rb file next to each manifest.json
contents of colour.rb
#-----
lambda { |output|
    return :red   if /^Errors and Failures\:/.match(output)
    return :green if /^Tests run: (\d*), Errors: 0, Failures: 0/.match(output)
    return :amber
}
#-----
Then do this...
#-----
colour = eval(IO.read('colour.rb'))
colour.call('FAILURES!')

Once this is in place I need an extra
test/app_lib/setup_data_checker_test
to verfiy each start-point has a colour.rb file

This works for katas done before the re-architecture.
It will fail if you switch start-points. I think that is a natural
consequence of the new architecture.

Need to do a lookup based on the unit_test_framework
Do a lookup in the languages and custom start-points for a matching unit_test_framework.

Or have a fall-back like I do for image_name.
See if colour-lanbda is stored locally in the kata.
If it is use it. This gives independence from start-point.
If its not, fall back to using parse_funcions inside the web image.
Will be much easier if I can embed the lambda inside the start-point manifest.
Can then simply copy the lambda into the kata manifest.

This also means I need to have the same kind of fall-back
when *forking* an old kata.

Inside the web container s/data/start-points/
is a good folder rename.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

When creating a kata (host_disk_katas.rb)
save language manifest properties into katas manifest
so all kata's methods look at least like image_name, viz
  manifest_property || start_point.NAME

diff-dialog from test page should have fork button.

In cli, change terminology from volume to start-point ?

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

$ cyber-dojo up
Have this display the arguments that are defaulted?, viz
Start-point: languages -> https://github.com/start-point-languages.git
Start-point: exercises -> https://github.com/start-point-exercises.git
Start-point:    custom -> https://github.com/start-point-custom.git
cyber-dojo up --languages=languages --exercises=exercises --custom=custom

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

if [docker pull] command on new setup pages fails then I need to
bail out of creating the kata.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Would be good to have a [cyber-dojo] cli command to export
a specific kata to a given folder. This would make it easier
to create custom exercises. Must not export to default VM
on Mac/Windows quickstart-terminal.

Make [cyber-dojo clean] remove dead containers as well as dead images?

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Looking to make some smaller alpine-linux language images.
Specifically, C#-NUnit and Java-JUnit

Java
frolvlad/alpine-oraclejdk8:slim
  How big is it? ~166.9 MB  (vs 843.7 MB)
  docker run --rm frolvlad/alpine-oraclejdk8:slim sh -c "javac -version"
    javac 1.8.0_92
  There is a package called junit (branch=edge, repo=testing)

Put Alpine based small images into cyberdojo repo.

Debug logging seems to show clean_up (in cyber-dojo.sh) being called twice...
Is this because (clean_up && exit_fail) is in () and so is a sub-shell?

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

new kata has been created dialog box, and here is its HEX-ID
  this could offer several buttons instead of just ok (which takes you back to home page)

    o) button to immediately start an avatar

Now that data is externalized I can arrange for it to
always be at the same locations inside the web container!
I don't need CYBER_DOJO_EXERCISES_ROOT et al.
But it is worth keeping them anyway for setting up
a local (not inside docker) web server?
No I don't need them for that either.

caches_dir needs to be ENV_VAR
Its used in app_controllers/setup_test.rb
Or rather a ROOT_DIR is needed. Really its RAILS_ROOT

Can these just be off RAILS_ROOT?
  caches/  YES
  downloads/  YES
  katas/ YES. Even if server uses non data-container /var/www/cyber-dojo/katas
              this can be mapped to /usr/src/cyber-dojo/katas
  data/  NO. not for local dev-server


CYBER_DOJO_DATA_ROOT
 can be anywhere inside web server, docker-compose.yml should just work
  as it volume-mounts to data-root automatically.
 points to data-repos on local server

get tests running and passing on local server first?

app_controllers tests has this warning
/usr/lib/ruby/gems/2.3.0/gems/activesupport-4.1.0/lib/active_support/values/time_zone.rb:285: warning: circular argument reference - now
Tried upgrading to Ruby 4.2.6
solves this as long Gemfile.lock is not part of the docker context
(remove it from web's dockerignore file)
This causes a few app_controller deprecation warnings
and a load of app_controller test fails which seem to be due to bad URLs

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Having Gemfile as part of web's docker image context is unfortunate.
It means the Alpine apk update stuff repeats unnecessarily if, for
example, you bump the rails version in Gemfile.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Occasional test failures...
  ForkerControllerTest#test_'EAE021',
    when language no longer exists, the fork fails, and the reason given is language
  SetupControllerTest#test_'EB77D9',
    show_exercises page uses cached exercises that are runnable

  Tests are defintely not unit-tests and almost certainly have order
  dependencies. State of cache files. How to resolve?

  I could reinstate FakeDisk, leave env-vars for data ROOTs, then
  fill FakeDisk with known content, then do access to dojo methods
  such as dojo.exercises

  For now, deleting caches at start of app_controller tests.

Note: need a check that each docker image has a user in it called nobody
      (I don't think it's uid is important)

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

If the server is up you can still do [docker rmi image]
So I still need proper nil error handling on the setup pages

)) ./cyber-dojo catalog

     $ ./cyber-dojo volume inspect VOL [VOL...]

       This would do the old catalog listing.
       This should show the origin (URL) of the volume.
       Need to make the languages checker work by being
       passed a path (there are now 2 manifest locations, exercises and languages)
       Then [volume inspect] call will then do
         docker run --rm -v VOL:/data sh -c "app/lib/check_setup_volume.rb /data"
           check_setup_volume.rb will parse ARGV etc and delegates to setup_volume_checker.rb

       test/languages/test_languages_manifest.rb
         Rework to utility rather than test with asserts.

       Ownership of all files should be cyber-dojo
           (comes in from a volume)

     cyber-dojo.rb could do with some documentation showing example output
     of various internal commands.

)) finish the what/how separation

     Union of collection. Do in later release.
     ./cyber-dojo up --exercises=alpha,beta
        With meta-data the command could simplify to [./cyber-dojo up a,b] ?? no.

        unioning affects the UX quite a lot.
        It also introduces the possiblity of manifests from different collections
        having an identical display_name...

        DONT add the collection name to the path because then it will *NOT* replace
        the default it will union with it...

        Unioning means I will somehow need to create multiple docker-compose yml files
        from a 'template'
        Don't really want multiple yml files - much simpler to pull just one
        from the web image when doing a [./cyber-dojo update]

     give collections a defined api and meta-data
       each collection manifest specifies if is for languages/exercises/instructions
       each volume label adds the URL it was created from
       each language manifest specifies whether its docker-image should be auto pulled. default=no

)) cyber-dojo data repos should be data only; move .rb files somewhere else.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

)) add another docker-compose.yml for main prod server
     prod server uses volume-mount for katas (not data-container)
     so I will need to use an docker-compose extension .yml file for
     specifying the katas (like I'll be doing for exercises/languages/instructions)

)) get latest image running on GCE
   Did it with hacked cyber-dojo script file that does not extract docker-compose.yml file
   from web container and mounts katas as a volume rather than a data-container.
   Had to make sure katas folder had user-rights matching user inside the web container.
   $ userdel cyber-dojo
   $ adduser --disabled-password --disabled-login --uid 19661 cyber-dojo

----------------------------------------

Day with James :-)


mkdir tryout
cd tryout
git clone https://github.com/JonJagger/cyber-dojo.git
cd cyber-dojo
git branch drop-katas-data-container origin/drop-katas-data-container
git checkout drop-katas-data-container

Edited app/docker/cyber-dojo to make two hard-wired env-vars for paths
point to new locations (under tryout)

Built a new web image

Tried to create a new server ontop of old one.
Could not do [./cyber-dojo restart]
>>>>>>It complained that cdf-nginx and cdf-web already existed.
Manually deleted them.

Started server.
Failed to create a kata because of permissions.
   (Note that katas is being volume-mounted (not volumes-from) in docker-compose.yml)
There is no cyber-dojo user.
On my dev default server
cat /etc/passwd
cyber-dojo:x:19661:19661:Linux User,,,:/home/cyber-dojo:/bin/sh

And this user does not exist on James's machine (Ubuntu)
$ adduser --disabled-password --no-create-home --uid 19661 cyber-dojo
Then
$ cd app/data
$ chown -R cyber-dojo katas

Then could create kata :-)
But problem with no root /cpputest folder (same as I had on my dev macbook)

$ docker run --rm -it cyberdojofoundation/cpp_cpputest sh
$ cd /
$ ls -al

Indeed there is no root folder /cpputest

Tried to recreate gpp_cpputest docker image
rebuilt image
didn't work
There is no user called cyber-dojo *inside* the gpp_cpputest container
Problem is that the image gpp_cpputest is not based FROM user-base
and so does not have cyber-dojo user inside it.
>>>>>>>I think this is not relevant. The user that runs inside the test container
is nobody. The cyber-dojo user is needed only inside the web container
(and also possibly on the host server for volume-mount interactions)


Switched create page to show plain languages
Make katas using C++, CppUTest (and C, CppUTest)
was ok, edited cyber-dojo.sh, /cpputest was there, got a red traffic-light
on the server went to katas/50/5C05.../manifest.json
language:C++ (g++)-CppUTest

Switched create page back to custom exercises.
Made new kata
katas/21/AD6F.../manifest.json
language:C

Aha!!!!
Manually edited the katas manifest.json
to "C++ (g++)-CppUTest"
and it worked. Woooooohoooooo

So the problem is the creation of the kata's manifest.
Looked at the code and fixed up the errors.
Works for both setup cases now: languages and exercises.

Retro: would be nice if you can find out the name of the
container/image from inside the container.

-------------

Tried again.

new server
installed docker
pulled from gihub
pulled new branch
edited app/docker/cyber-dojo to make two hard-wired env-vars for paths
built a new web image
>>>>>>>>tried to create kata - failed with nil Rails error.
Look into this on my own server.

Features James mentioned during our chat
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

revert button is in diff dialog again

feature: on enter page, when kata id is entered and buttons become enabled
         it would be nice to see the language and exercise names in the footer.

feature: sed in the editor (search and replace)

feature: copy one animal to a new one (keeping whole traffic-light history)

feature: fork giving two options, viz create new start-points data.

feature: replace duration on dashboard with time-ticks on top of minute columns.

feature: hovering over a traffic-light gives more detail, viz for changed files (not output)
         name of file, no of deleted lines, no of added lines

feature: traffic-lights have some visual indication if there is a
         "suspiciously large change"
         eg more than 1 file changed
         eg more than 3 lines changed in a non-test file

feature: hyperlink of compiler error on output to file and line number

feature: only one error in C/C++ projects

feature: colour syntax

un-hardwire setting of 2 core env-vars in cyber-dojo script.
  export CYBER_DOJO_DATA_ROOT="/home/docker/data"
  export CYBER_DOJO_KATAS_ROOT="/home/docker/data/katas"

instructions refactored to be manifest'ed
  use disk[path].each_rdir('instructions') in its make_cache()
  Only instructions file would be shown on 2nd setup page.
