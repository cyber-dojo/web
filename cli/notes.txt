if [docker pull] command on new setup pages fails then I need to
bail out of creating the kata.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Add display-name (major,minor) etc to footer on enter page.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

new kata has been created dialog box, and here is its HEX-ID
  this could offer several buttons instead of just ok (which takes you back to home page)
    o) button to take you to home page
    o) button to take you to enter page
    o) button to immediately start an avatar
       from revert this needs to leave originating page alone
       from setup page this needs to put page back to home

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

setup page default-start-points
  on 1st step have 2 buttons
    [choose exercise] [setup now]
or
  on 2nd step
    [setup with no exercise] [setup now]

=========================================
=========================================

When creating a kata (host_disk_katas.rb)
save language manifest properties into katas manifest
so all kata's methods look at least like image_name, viz
  manifest_property || start_point.NAME

Add C# XUnit test framework.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Move runners from lib/code to app/lib/code

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

web_base/Dockerfile still has this line
   && cd ${CYBER_DOJO_HOME} ; bundle install --without development test \

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Would be good to have a [cyber-dojo] cli command to export
a specific kata to a given folder. This would make it easier
to create custom exercises. Must not export to default VM
on Mac/Windows quickstart-terminal.

Make [cyber-dojo clean] remove dead containers as well as dead images?

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Looking to make some smaller alpine-linux language images.
Specifically, C#-NUnit and Java-JUnit

Java
frolvlad/alpine-oraclejdk8:slim
  How big is it? ~166.9 MB  (vs 843.7 MB)
  docker run --rm frolvlad/alpine-oraclejdk8:slim sh -c "javac -version"
    javac 1.8.0_92
  There is a package called junit (branch=edge, repo=testing)

Put Alpine based small images into cyberdojo repo.

Debug logging seems to show clean_up (in cyber-dojo.sh) being called twice...
Is this because (clean_up && exit_fail) is in () and so is a sub-shell?

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

git 2.9+ has new  `--compaction-heuristic`
for improved diffs. Try to get this in place.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

test/app_lib/start_points/languages
test/app_lib/start_points/exercises
test/app_lib/start_points/custom
These should all have the data-checker run against them as part of the tests.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

add [ci skip] to git commit messages if you want
to skip the travis build

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

cyber-dojo.rb failure messages are
FAILED: ....
Check what [docker] does and mimic that.
$ docker images --ssss
flag provided but not defined: --ssss
See 'docker images --help'.
Test these with shunit2 tests.

app_controllers tests has this warning
/usr/lib/ruby/gems/2.3.0/gems/activesupport-4.1.0/lib/active_support/values/time_zone.rb:285: warning: circular argument reference - now
Tried upgrading to Ruby 4.2.6
solves this as long Gemfile.lock is not part of the docker context
(remove it from web's dockerignore file)
This causes a few app_controller deprecation warnings
and a load of app_controller test fails which seem to be due to bad URLs

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Occasional test failures...
  ForkerControllerTest#test_'EAE021',
    when language no longer exists, the fork fails, and the reason given is language
  SetupControllerTest#test_'EB77D9',
    show_exercises page uses cached exercises that are runnable

  Tests are defintely not unit-tests and almost certainly have order
  dependencies. State of cache files. How to resolve?

  I could reinstate FakeDisk, leave env-vars for data ROOTs, then
  fill FakeDisk with known content, then do access to dojo methods
  such as dojo.exercises

  For now, deleting caches at start of app_controller tests.

Note: need a check that each docker image has a user in it called nobody
      (I don't think it's uid is important)

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

If the server is up you can still do [docker rmi image]
So I still need proper nil error handling on the setup pages

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

)) add another docker-compose.yml for main prod server
     prod server uses volume-mount for katas (not data-container)
     so I will need to use an docker-compose extension .yml file for
     specifying the katas (like I'll be doing for exercises/languages/instructions)

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

)) get latest image running on GCE
   Did it with hacked cyber-dojo script file that does not extract docker-compose.yml file
   from web container and mounts katas as a volume rather than a data-container.
   Had to make sure katas folder had user-rights matching user inside the web container.
   $ userdel cyber-dojo
   $ adduser --disabled-password --disabled-login --uid 19661 cyber-dojo
   $ cd /var/www/cyber-dojo
   $ sudo chown -R cyber-dojo:cyber-dojo katas
   $ cd ~
   $ sudo ./cyber-dojo pull all
   $ sudo ./cyber-dojo up

   Need to comment out this line in cyber-dojo.sh
     # one_time_creation_of_katas_data_container
   Need to remove this line from docker-compose.yml
     volumes_from:
       - ${CYBER_DOJO_KATAS_DATA_CONTAINER}:rw
   Need to add this
     volumes:
       - /var/www/cyber-dojo/katas:${CYBER_DOJO_ROOT}/katas:rw

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

)) get travis to push images to cdf hub
   push images to cyberdojofoundation hub if tests pass

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

)) documentation

)) add confirmation diagnostic to each [cyber-dojo] command?

Features James mentioned during our chat
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

revert button is in diff dialog again

feature: on enter page, when kata id is entered and buttons become enabled
         it would be nice to see the display_name in the footer.

feature: sed in the editor (search and replace)

feature: copy one animal to a new one (keeping whole traffic-light history)

feature: fork giving two options, viz create new kata and create start-point

feature: replace duration on dashboard with time-ticks on top of minute columns.

feature: hovering over a traffic-light gives more detail, viz for changed files (not output)
         name of file, no of deleted lines, no of added lines

feature: traffic-lights have some visual indication if there is a
         "suspiciously large change"
         eg more than 1 file changed
         eg more than 3 lines changed in a non-test file

feature: hyperlink of compiler error on output to file and line number

feature: only one error in C/C++ projects

feature: colour syntax

un-hardwire setting of 2 core env-vars in cyber-dojo script.
  export CYBER_DOJO_DATA_ROOT="/home/docker/data"
  export CYBER_DOJO_KATAS_ROOT="/home/docker/data/katas"

instructions refactored to be manifest'ed
  use disk[path].each_rdir('instructions') in its make_cache()
  Only instructions file would be shown on 2nd setup page.
