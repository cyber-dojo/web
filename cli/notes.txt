an output file is actually stored in the sandbox of an avatar.
this is not right. it means the avatar cant create an output file
for itself. The output 'file' should only be in the manifest.

differ is a good candidate for separating out into its own service.
it can received two json strings contains the visible_files of the
was_tag and the now_tag. It can return a json string of the diff
(but not html-ified). web service would link to differ service
and web service would need to use ENV-vars to find its IP address etc
CYBER_DOJO_DIFFER_PORT='tcp://172.17.0.3:3000'
See https://github.com/sashaegorov/docker-alpine-sinatra
If the katas object (saver) can be decoupled from git it will be a big
win for testing as I could then re-instate FakeDisk. Katas object could
o) have a single not-git'ed folder structure per animal
   use sandbox directly for tar-piping
      new/changed files get added to it
      deleted files get rm'd from it
   above sandbox
      manifest.json (one time creation)
      increments.json (appended to each test-event)
o) hold one folder per tag storing visible_files.json for that tag
   this allows diff re-creation. Possibly store this in compressed form.

git 2.9+ has new  `--compaction-heuristic`
for improved diffs. Try to get this in place.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Having differ as a separate service will make the (re)creation of the
kata's tar file for the download button more involved.
Downloader could also be a new service.

change output of [./cyber-dojo start-point ls] from relative paths to absolute paths

for tests I have to put red_amber_green lambdas (such as bash_unit)
into the output.colour_of. Can this dependency be broken?

web_base/Dockerfile still has this line

Would be good to have a [cyber-dojo] cli command to export
a specific kata to a given folder. This would make it easier
to create custom exercises. Must not export to default VM
on Mac/Windows quickstart-terminal.

Make [cyber-dojo clean] remove dead containers as well as dead images?

Looking to make some smaller alpine-linux language images.
Specifically, C#-NUnit and Java-JUnit

Java
frolvlad/alpine-oraclejdk8:slim
  How big is it? ~166.9 MB  (vs 843.7 MB)
  docker run --rm frolvlad/alpine-oraclejdk8:slim sh -c "javac -version"
    javac 1.8.0_92
  There is a package called junit (branch=edge, repo=testing)

Put Alpine based small images into cyberdojo repo.

un-hardwire setting of 2 core env-vars in cyber-dojo script.

instructions refactored to be manifest'ed
  use disk[path].each_rdir('instructions') in its make_cache()

app_controllers tests has this warning
/usr/lib/ruby/gems/2.3.0/gems/activesupport-4.1.0/lib/active_support/values/time_zone.rb:285: warning: circular argument reference - now
Tried upgrading to Ruby 4.2.6
solves this as long Gemfile.lock is not part of the docker context
(remove it from web's dockerignore file)
This causes a few app_controller deprecation warnings
and a load of app_controller test fails which seem to be due to bad URLs

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Occasional test failures...
  ForkerControllerTest#test_'EAE021',
    when language no longer exists, the fork fails, and the reason given is language
  SetupControllerTest#test_'EB77D9',
    show_exercises page uses cached exercises that are runnable

  Tests are defintely not unit-tests and almost certainly have order
  dependencies. State of cache files. How to resolve?

  I could reinstate FakeDisk, leave env-vars for data ROOTs, then
  fill FakeDisk with known content, then do access to dojo methods
  such as dojo.exercises

  For now, deleting caches at start of app_controller tests.

Note: need a check that each docker image has a user in it called nobody
      (I don't think it's uid is important)

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

If the server is up you can still do [docker rmi image]
So I still need proper nil error handling on the setup pages

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

)) add another docker-compose.yml for main prod server
     prod server uses volume-mount for katas (not data-container)
     so I will need to use an docker-compose extension .yml file for
     specifying the katas (like I'll be doing for exercises/languages/instructions)

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

)) get latest image running on GCE
   Did it with hacked cyber-dojo script file that does not extract docker-compose.yml file
   from web container and mounts katas as a volume rather than a data-container.
   Had to make sure katas folder had user-rights matching user inside the web container.
   $ userdel cyber-dojo
   $ adduser --disabled-password --disabled-login --uid 19661 cyber-dojo
   $ cd /var/www/cyber-dojo
   $ sudo chown -R cyber-dojo:cyber-dojo katas
   $ cd ~
   $ sudo ./cyber-dojo pull all
   $ sudo ./cyber-dojo up

   Need to comment out this line in cyber-dojo.sh
     # one_time_creation_of_katas_data_container
   Need to remove this line from docker-compose.yml
     volumes_from:
       - ${CYBER_DOJO_KATAS_DATA_CONTAINER}:rw
   Need to add this
     volumes:
       - /var/www/cyber-dojo/katas:${CYBER_DOJO_ROOT}/katas:rw

Features James mentioned during our chat
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

feature: on enter page, when kata id is entered and buttons become enabled
         it would be nice to see the display_name in the footer.

feature: sed in the editor (search and replace)

feature: copy one animal to a new one (keeping whole traffic-light history)

feature: fork giving two options, viz create new kata and create start-point

feature: replace duration on dashboard with time-ticks on top of minute columns.

feature: hovering over a traffic-light gives more detail, viz for changed files (not output)
         name of file, no of deleted lines, no of added lines

feature: traffic-lights have some visual indication if there is a
         "suspiciously large change"
         eg more than 1 file changed
         eg more than 3 lines changed in a non-test file

feature: hyperlink of compiler error on output to file and line number

feature: only one error in C/C++ projects

feature: colour syntax
