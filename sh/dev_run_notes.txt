If you are working on web there are 2 ways of
getting feedback on your local work:

1) /build_test.sh
   This runs the tests locally.
   To use locally built dependent services you may need to add SHA/TAG
   env-vars to the echo_versioner_env_vars.sh file.

2) /demo.sh
   This runs a local server
   It uses docker-compose, versioner, and its own docker-compose yml files.
