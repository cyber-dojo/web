only show revert traffic-light
  viz don't also show the incorrect-prediction traffic-light before it.
  DONE. But long delay before new last (revert) light scrolls into view...

sometimes the revert is not happening... :-(
  eg code is a red (6 * 89), predict=on, revert[green]=on, click green
  get red x traffic-light but no revert happens...
  OR maybe it is happening but the scrollLastTrafficLightIntoView timeout hack
    is obscuring things... 

make model calls for persistence in shared/settings
  remove console.log calls.

add hover-tip for individual counts.

maybe colour the bg of [revert if wrong!] text to something
   other than grey (to be distinct from predict text) and colour
   bg of 3 auto-revert checkboxes to match.

on traffic-lights counts; how to show current light is non rag?, eg timed-out

reduce width of kata #traffic-lights so
   gap at rhs to counts

revert counts logically has a 4th category... outcome not red/amber/green,
  eg timed_out
  show this.
