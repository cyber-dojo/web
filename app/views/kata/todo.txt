On light hover-tip filename, use dedicated CSS style to reduce width
   (not one from file-knave)

?Make the [checkout] button disabled for an incorrect prediction
that had revert on for that colour (for the same kata.id)
Best way is to add revert data to event summary for a failed prediction.
  - Submit the prediction (for that colour) to the server. DONE
  - Look for this in review page to set checkout disabled state.
  - Maybe later, polyfill this on model so it works for old katas too?

Add [our charity] button above sponsors.

Reduce width of kata #traffic-lights so less cramped last light hover-tip?
  - Reduce width of hovertip filename will help too. Does not need fixed-width.
  - Same for review page.


Add hover-tip for individual counts?

Add light-counts to review page.

Add predict-counts to review page.

Recolour diff[x] checkbox cell backgrounds to match checkboxes on edit page.

Release to beta.

Maybe colour the bg of [revert if wrong!] title-text to something
   other than grey (to be distinct from predict text) and colour
   bg of 3 auto-revert checkboxes to match.

provide model.revert() method as alias for model.ran_tests() and use in kata-controller
provide model.checkout() method as alias for model.ran_tests() and use in kata-controller
