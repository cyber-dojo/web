sometimes the revert is not happening... :-(
  eg code is a red (6 * 89), predict=on, revert[green]=on, click green
  get red x traffic-light but no revert happens...

make model calls for persistence in shared/settings
  remove console.log calls.

after showPredictImages() I need to scroll to the last traffic-light...

formatting of predict counts is not right.
  eg 3,12,0  for tick,cross,revert
  shows the cross img further right because 12 has 2 digits
  Maybe just show the tick,cross,revert image first (leftmost).

add hover-tip for predict counts.

only show revert traffic-light
  viz don't also show the incorrect-prediction traffic-light before it.

show predicted colour as background on predict counts.

maybe colour the bg of [auto-revert if wrong!] text to something
   other than grey (to be distinct from predict text) and colour
   bg of 3 auto-revert checkboxes to match.
