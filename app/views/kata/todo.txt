make model calls for persistence in shared/settings

after showPredictImages() I need to scroll to the last traffic-light...

formatting of predict counts is not right.
  eg 3,12,0  for tick,cross,revert
  shows the cross img further right because 12 has 2 digits

only show revert traffic-light
  viz don't also show the incorrect-prediction traffic-light before it.

show predicted colour as background on predict counts.
