If predict is off and you refresh a page you should not see
the tick/cross/revert.

On revert, switch to review-mode for the incorrect light so you
can easily see its stdout/stderr/status (and files).
Make the [checkout] button disabled though?

Separate out the revert count from the predict counts?
I think so. Especially when predict has a visible total.

make model calls for persistence in shared/settings
  remove console.log calls.

add hover-tip for individual counts?

maybe colour the bg of [revert if wrong!] text to something
   other than grey (to be distinct from predict text) and colour
   bg of 3 auto-revert checkboxes to match.

on traffic-lights counts; how to show current light is non rag?,
  eg timed-out, what background colour?

reduce width of kata #traffic-lights so
   gap at rhs to counts

revert counts logically has a 4th category... outcome not red/amber/green,
  eg timed_out
  show this?
