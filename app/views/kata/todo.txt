number of full size diff traffic-lights == no of [test] runs
- auto-revert is a large <-  arrow
- checkout from your own kata is a large <- arrow too
- checkout from a different kata is a down-arrow

full-size revert/checkout images need to be used on review page.

On kata+review page, hover-tip for traffic-lights
- uses word 'revert' for going back to one of your own
  traffic-lights, either via auto-revert, or [revert]
  and does not mention the avatar's name (if there is one).
- uses word 'checkout' for doing a [checkout] from
  a different avatar's traffic-light.

When checkout button says [checkout] use fuller hover-tip.

make sure to update dashboard traffic-lights CSS
with half-width border-radius before pushing nginx.
