Switched back to showing cross and revert lights for an
incorrect prediction when its revert checkbox is ticked.

Separate out the revert count from the predict counts?
I think so. Especially when predict has a visible total.

sometimes the revert is not happening... :-(
  eg code is a red (6 * 89), predict=on, revert[green]=on, click green
  get red x traffic-light but no revert happens...
  It does happen. But not visible...
  OR maybe it is happening but the scrollLastTrafficLightIntoView timeout hack
    is obscuring things...

make model calls for persistence in shared/settings
  remove console.log calls.

add hover-tip for individual counts.

maybe colour the bg of [revert if wrong!] text to something
   other than grey (to be distinct from predict text) and colour
   bg of 3 auto-revert checkboxes to match.

on traffic-lights counts; how to show current light is non rag?, eg timed-out

reduce width of kata #traffic-lights so
   gap at rhs to counts

revert counts logically has a 4th category... outcome not red/amber/green,
  eg timed_out
  show this.
