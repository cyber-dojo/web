Either way, make the [checkout] button disabled to undo from a cross
(followed by a revert) for the same kata.id
Best way is to add revert data to event summary for a failed prediction.
Maybe polyfill this on model so it works for old katas too?

add hover-tip for individual counts?

On revert, switch to review-mode for the incorrect light so you
can easily see its stdout/stderr/status (and files)?


maybe recolour diff[x] checkbox cell backgrounds to match checkboxes on edit page?

maybe colour the bg of [revert if wrong!] title-text to something
   other than grey (to be distinct from predict text) and colour
   bg of 3 auto-revert checkboxes to match.

reduce width of kata #traffic-lights so less cramped last light hover-tip?

provide model.revert() method as alias for model.ran_tests() and use in kata-controller
provide model.checkout() method as alias for model.ran_tests() and use in kata-controller
