Add light-counts to review page.

Add predict-counts to review page.

Add sponsors to review page.

In review-mode, always do diff-summary of index,index-1
and always show file-type markers. Make the diff[x] checkbox
control whether the [+][-] diffs are visible. Need to try this.
What about [+] created files and [-] deleted files?

Recolour diff[x] checkbox cell backgrounds to match checkboxes on edit page.

Polyfill old checkouts on model?

Reduce width of hovertip filename will help too. Does not need fixed-width like filename-knave.
  - Same for review page.

Add hover-tip for individual counts?

Maybe colour the bg of [revert if wrong!] title-text to something
   other than grey (to be distinct from predict text) and colour
   bg of 3 auto-revert checkboxes to match.

provide model.revert() method as alias for model.ran_tests() and use in kata-controller

provide model.checkout() method as alias for model.ran_tests() and use in kata-controller
