app/controllers/application_controller.rb container render 404, 500
In web, improve dialog-box errors, eg when you get a server 500
 this needs to be logged so it is visible in a docker-logs command.

In revert_test.rb instead of 
  @files[filename] = 'Hello'
if you write
  @files[filename] = {'content' => 'Hello'}
then it seems to cause saver to silently drop its incoming call.
There needs to be some pydantic-like checking of the parameters.

Any app-controller tests use RunnerService when they could use RunnerStub?

Are app-controller tests still using v0/v1 manifests?
  Use v2 in all tests.
  Create multi-version-tests? See source/test/test_base.rb v_tests

Need to find how to put the actual 404/500 error message into the view.
  source/config/environments/production.rb
    # Show raw exceptions
    config.action_dispatch.show_exceptions = true
    # Show full error reports
    config.consider_all_requests_local = true

- checkout/revert now gives you (<-) and (V) icons, but they
  disappear when you do a refresh.

- If you revert/checkout then the tooltip for the (<-) icon is undefined.undefined.
  This is because in the controller I don't add major/minor indexes to the 
  traffic-light for those events.

- In saver, a traffic-light (non file-event) is currently returned with minor_index==''
  It would be better if this was minor_index=0
  But still only show the major_index for a traffic-light.

- Merge details[x] & diffs[x] into 3 choice radio-buttons.
    diff
    (o) off 
    (o) on (lights only, red/amber/green only)
    (o) detailed (show file-events)
  and on the dashboard have diff-extra[x] checkbox.

- With diff-detailed, if you click a file-created icon, the new filename 
  is not selected in the tool-tip. It needs to be.

- In review mode with diff-detailed selected, when a RAG is chosen the selection picks a non 
  s/s/s file. Instead, select a single 'output' filename instead of stdout/stderr/status 
  (same as [test] page).

- Make tool-tip for checkout/revert make it more obvious what the difference is.

- The diff tool-tip when details[x] now looks too busy.
  A RAG does not need a diff at all!
  The file-events themselves can each contain details of the one file they are about. 
  Eg Instead of...
    - + =
        15 = readme.txt
    1 1  7 ! hiker.sh 
         8 = test_hiker.sh
         3 = bats_help.sh
         2 = cyber-dojo.sh 
  
   it can be simply...
    1 1  hiker.sh 

- In traffic-light-navigator, I think lastEventIndex() and lastEventIndex()
  can be simplified using code in _review.html.erb

- In dashboard, in refresh.js save events in global so they are available 
  to JS, eg to calculate the previous index. Prepares the way for details[x]
  checkbox in dashboard.

- Update [download] tooltip to say "1 comment per test/edit event"

- Fix layout/CSS for review-mode from dashboard

- Switched to a dotted-index view
  Check CSS copes with variable size in traffic-light-navigator, eg
  [<] [14.22] [>]
  Don't want it to change size, so need to increase the width.
  Have 2 sizes for the index box
   - larger  for diff-detailed ON
   - smaller for diff-detailed OFF

- Showing incorrect predictions is done with a small (x) icon at the top-left
  of the RAG. Tweak this (x) so the background colour of the (x) is red/amber/green 
  (instead of just colouring the border).

- Showing reverted traffic-lights is currently shown with a big (<-) icon.
  Change this to a small (<-) uncoloured icon (same size as incorrect prediction)
  at the top-left of a regular RAG traffic-light. Idea is to make it more obvious
  which events are RAGs.

- Polyfill old checkouts on saver model?
  having index=0 -> colour="create" would be handy.
  adding diff-added/deleted-count in index=0 also

- Refactor JS so refresh methods are called only when needed.

- In demo, add events for 'faulty' and 'pulling'.
  Check review with details[x] and moving [<][>] across them

- cd.lib.isLight(event) also gives true for create event. Not clear?
  Add cd.lib.isTest(event) and check that also gives true for 
  'faulty' and 'pulling'
  Maybe rename cd.lib.isFileEvent to cd.lib.isMinor(event)?
  Could implement cd.lib.isLight() as !cd.lib.isFileEvent()?

- Sometimes get RAG tool-tip appearing in top-left and not going away.
  Maybe set a timeout of eg 5? seconds so it always goes away?

------------------------------------------------------------------

- pre-release
- switch web to call saver.ran_tests() instead of saver.ran_tests2()      
- comment out JS calls to file-create/delete/rename/edit 
- do careful check that everything still works: 
    [test]-review, [dashboard]-review, revert, checkout, predict, etc
- check for stability, continue testing/checking

- release
  - use saver.ran_tests2()
  - turn on file-create/delete/rename/edit
  - check index numbering in details mode

- post-release
  o) reimplement saver.ran_test() to be the same as saver.ran_tests2()
  o) switch web to call saver.ran_tests()
  o) delete saver.ran_tests2()
