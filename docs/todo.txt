app/controllers/application_controller.rb container render 404, 500
In web, improve dialog-box errors, eg when you get a server 500
 this needs to be logged so it is visible in a docker-logs command.

In revert_test.rb instead of 
  @files[filename] = 'Hello'
if you write
  @files[filename] = {'content' => 'Hello'}
then it seems to cause saver to silently drop its incoming call.
There needs to be some pydantic-like checking of the parameters.

Any app-controller tests use RunnerService when they could use RunnerStub?

Are app-controller tests still using v0/v1 manifests?
  Use v2 in all tests.
  Create multi-version-tests? See source/test/test_base.rb v_tests

Need to find how to put the actual 404/500 error message into the view.
  source/config/environments/production.rb
    # Show raw exceptions
    config.action_dispatch.show_exceptions = true
    # Show full error reports
    config.consider_all_requests_local = true

Saver currently always returns minor_index=0 from v2 git_commit_tag_sss
  Is this correct? 
  I think it is, as long as you can only checkout/revert from a RAG event.
  The new file-event methods return only next_index, but if a non-RAG
  saver method returned the full triple, then the minor_index=0 would be wrong.

Dashboard, in refresh.js save events in global so they are available 
  to JS, eg to calculate the previous index. Prepares the way for details[x]
  checkbox in dashboard.

------------------------------------------------------------------

- ?Tweak resume/revert/checkout button tool-tips to say 
    Click to resume with ????
    
    Click to resume with the files of:
      panda 1 Red
    You are a panda

    Click to resume with the files of: 
      lion 2 Green
    You are a panda

- When you revert/checkout then lots of files are potentially changed at once.
  These files are not just reverted in the browser - but in saver too. 
  This is correct.

- Make revert/checkout/fork buttons slightly bigger.

- Tweak [fork] button tool-tip to say 
  "Create a new practice with the files of: penguin 1 red"

- Suppose you are in [test] mode, do an edit, then switch to review mode.
  Should this switch cause a file-edit event?
  Yes. And this may update kata.index which you can then see!
  And then the revert/checkout (which may not happen) can proceed as normal.

- If there are no minor-index == 0 events then remove/disable the (o)details radio button.
  First step for this is to add all the radio buttons dynamically in Javascript.
  There is a quick way to determine if a kata has any file-events
    event = events[-1]
    no_file_events = (event['index'] == event['major_index'])

- Increase height and the width of code in [review] page to match that in [test] page.

- When you [revert] or [checkout] does the output s/s/s get restored?
  It should do. Check it.

- Currently, in review mode, you sometimes go back to index==0 
  (when diff is ON and you switch avatar)
    Would it be better, by default, to go back to index=1
    which is the first actual change?
    Or if diff-mode=light-light, to the first actual light?
    Yes. This will mean you don't, by default, get "0 Create" in a revert/checkout tool-tip.

- If there are a lot of file-events and you switch on diff-details make sure 
  that the currently selected event is still visible - there could be a lot more events
  requiring the current one to be scrolled back into view.

- In review mode with diff-detailed selected, when a RAG is chosen the selection picks a non 
  s/s/s file. Instead, select a single 'output' filename instead of stdout/stderr/status 
  (same as [test] page).

- In the event tool-tip diff, raise the filename slightly so it aligns 
  vertically with the +/- counts.

- In traffic-light-navigator, I think lastEventIndex() and lastEventIndex()
  can be simplified using code in _review.html.erb

- Switched to a dotted-index view
  Check CSS copes with variable size in traffic-light-navigator, eg
  [<] [14.22] [>]
  Don't want it to change size, so need to increase the width.
  Have 2 sizes for the index box
   - larger  for diff-detailed ON
   - smaller for diff-detailed OFF

- On the dashboard have diff-extra[x] checkbox.

- Polyfill old checkouts on saver model?
  having index=0 -> colour="create" would be handy.
  adding diff-added/deleted-count in index=0 also

- Refactor JS so refresh methods are called only when needed.

- In demo, add events for 'faulty' and 'pulling'.
  Check review with details[x] and moving [<][>] across them

- cd.lib.isLight(event) also gives true for create event. Not clear?
  Add cd.lib.isTest(event) and check that also gives true for 
  'faulty' and 'pulling'
  Maybe rename cd.lib.isFileEvent to cd.lib.isMinor(event)?

- Sometimes get RAG tool-tip appearing in top-left and not going away.
  Maybe set a timeout of a few seconds so it always goes away?

------------------------------------------------------------------

- pre-release
- switch web to call saver.ran_tests() instead of saver.ran_tests2()      
- comment out JS calls to file-create/delete/rename/edit 
- do careful check that everything still works: 
    [test]-review, [dashboard]-review, revert, checkout, predict, etc
- check for stability, continue testing/checking

- release
  - use saver.ran_tests2()
  - turn on file-create/delete/rename/edit
  - check index numbering in details mode

- post-release
  o) reimplement saver.ran_test() to be the same as saver.ran_tests2()
  o) switch web to call saver.ran_tests()
  o) delete saver.ran_tests2()
