app/controllers/application_controller.rb container render 404, 500
In web, improve dialog-box errors, eg when you get a server 500
 this needs to be logged so it is visible in a docker-logs command.

Any app-controller tests use RunnerService when they could use RunnerStub?

Are app-controller tests still using v0/v1 manifests?
  Use v2 in all tests.
  Create multi-version-tests? See source/test/test_base.rb v_tests

Need to find how to put the actual 404/500 error message into the view.
  source/config/environments/production.rb
    # Show raw exceptions
    config.action_dispatch.show_exceptions = true
    # Show full error reports
    config.consider_all_requests_local = true


saver
-----

In web's revert_test.rb instead of 
  @files[filename] = 'Hello'
if you write
  @files[filename] = {'content' => 'Hello'}
then it seems to cause saver to silently drop its incoming call.
There needs to be some pydantic-like checking of the parameters.

Currently always returns minor_index=0 from v2 git_commit_tag_sss
  Is this correct? 
  I think it is, as long as you can only checkout/revert from a RAG event.
  The new file-event methods return only next_index, but if a non-RAG
  saver method returned the full triple, then the minor_index=0 would be wrong.


dashboard
---------

Fix tool-tip for v0, v1 katas.

Add diff-extra[x] checkbox.

In refresh.js save events in global so they are available 
  to JS, eg to calculate the previous index. Prepares the way for details[x]
  checkbox in dashboard.

------------------------------------------------------------------
  
- if dashboard's detailed[x] and you click a RAG, it would be nice if
  the review opened in detailed[x] mode.
  http://localhost/review/show/nGnDsn?now_index=3
  would become, eg
  http://localhost/review/show/nGnDsn?now_index=3&diff=detailed

- replace now_index in URLs with index 

- In review mode, ideally the stdout lines would begin with line number 1,
  then stderr lines would begin with line number 1,
  then status would be line number 1 too.

- When you run a demo and hit refresh, the [output] for the most recent RAG 
  is empty. However, when you run [test] again, the output is correct.

- In review mode, when you move from a diff=detailed on a file-event (eg 3.4), 
  to diff=test-test, and then back to diff=detailed would it be nice if 
  you went back to 3.4 and not 3 ?

- _index.html.erb has this...
  review.lastEventIndex = () => {
    ...
    if (cd.review.diffRadio.isDetailed()) {
      return lastIndex; // TODO: Dont think we ever get here...
    }
    ... 
  };

- In traffic-light-navigator, I think lastEventIndex() and lastEventIndex()
  can be simplified using code in _review.html.erb

- Increase height and the width of code in [review] page to match that in [test] page.

- Refactor JS so refresh methods are called only when needed.

- In demo, add events for 'faulty' and 'pulling'.
  Check review with details[x] and moving [<][>] across them

- cd.lib.isLight(event) also gives true for create event. Not clear?
  Add cd.lib.isTest(event) and check that also gives true for 
  'faulty' and 'pulling'
  Maybe rename cd.lib.isFileEvent to cd.lib.isMinor(event)?

------------------------------------------------------------------

- pre-release
- switch web to call saver.ran_tests() instead of saver.ran_tests2()      
- comment out JS calls to file-create/delete/rename/edit 
- do careful check that everything still works: 
    [test]-review, [dashboard]-review, revert, checkout, predict, etc
- check for stability, continue testing/checking

- release
  - use saver.ran_tests2()
  - turn on file-create/delete/rename/edit
  - check index numbering in details mode

- post-release
  o) reimplement saver.ran_test() to be the same as saver.ran_tests2()
  o) switch web to call saver.ran_tests()
  o) delete saver.ran_tests2()
