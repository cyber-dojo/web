Controller-tests currently use v1 kata which means that
in app_controller_test_base.rb we have this:

  def post_run_tests(options = {})
    post '/kata/run_tests', params:run_test_params(options)
    @index += 1
    assert_response :success, response.body
  end

which cannot be updated to get the POST response.
Need to upgrade the tests so they use a v2 kata

In review-mode, always do diff-summary of index,index-1
and always show file-type markers. Make the diff[x] checkbox
control whether the [+][-] diffs are visible. Need to try this.
What about [+] created files and [-] deleted files?

Polyfill old checkouts on model?
