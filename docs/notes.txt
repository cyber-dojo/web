Still to do
- only show one traffic-light (which has no tool-tip and no click-handler)
  This is not simply a case of turning off full-view controls
  one of which is all the traffic-lights.
  I also have to put in a single traffic-light.
  It seems I do need a mode for this.
- [test] has to somehow open stdout/stderr
  Again it seems like I'll need a explicit mode for this.
- Alt-O to toggle back/forth?

------------------------------------------

IDE's have a lot of richness in the way devs create code.
But they have a lot less richness in the feedback of the
results of that code.
I would like cyber-dojo to try to be richer in its feedback.
Have two modes:

- INPUT
  - a [test] button which takes you to OUTPUT
  - [new file] [rename file] [delete file] buttons
  - the source files in alphabetical order
  - no stdout/stderr/status

- OUTPUT
  - a [resume] button which takes you back to INPUT
  - a single traffic-light (not the full sequence)
  - no traffic-light < > navigation
  - no diff check-box
  - no fork/revert/download buttons
  - at the _top_, stdout/stderr/status in plain view (not diffed)
  - below sss, a diff view of the source files

A good first step in preparing for this would be to
cyber-dojo.sh/makefile/etc back into the main filelist
and have only stdout/stderr/status below that.

So the diff-view has 3 'modes'

1. its own page with its own URL, reached from dashboard
   - full functionality
   - shows files at top with diffs
   - shows sss underneath with no diffs
2. as pseudo dialog from kata page, reached by pressing [test]
   - [resume] button
     o) takes you back to [test] page at the same file with same cursor
   - two traffic-lights, previous and current, neither with the underbar
     or perhaps just the two sequence numbers, eg
        4 -> 5  with both 4 and 5 in their respective colour
   - no < > navigation
   - no diff check-box
   - no fork/revert/download buttons?
     or maybe allow fork, NOT revert, allow download
   - sss at the TOP in no-diff view
     o) one of stdout/stderr will be opened
   - files below sss in diff view
3. as pseudo dialog from kata page, reached by pressing a traffic-light
   - [resume] button
     o) takes you back to [test] page at the same file with same cursor
   - full sequence of traffic-lights, current one with underbar
   - < > navigation
   - diff check-box
   - fork/revert/download buttons
   - files at the TOP in diff-view
   - sss below in no-diff view


Questions...
In mode 2 how will sss align with the filenames?
sss do not have +- box-counts and the filenames do.
Left-align both?
Perhaps have 2 diff-checkboxes
- one for sss which is off by default
- one for filenames which is on by default
