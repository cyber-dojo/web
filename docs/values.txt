Cyber-dojo values
-----------------

1. It should support teams first, and individuals second.
In fact, early versions only supported teams.

2. Use should be anonymous.
More specifically, it should be possible (and the default)
that reviews are done against the visible code without
knowledge of who wrote it. For example, a reviewer might
suggest the lion(s) wrote the code this way because of such
and such. And it is up to the lions to decide whether to
reveal who they are, and whether the reviewer is correct.

3. Tests and code have equal importance.
Stable systems tend to oppose their own proper function.
The Equilibrium Law.

4. Part of practice is going slower, not faster.
More carefully. More deliberately.

5. Outputs are important.
For example, one feature request was for the output to always be
visible, below the source, and only a few lines in height.
I decided not to do that. Partly because cyber-dojo is not about speeding up.
Also, an important part of TDD is carefully reading the output.
So instead, output has its own tab, on the rhs.

An overall UX theme is that inputs happen on the left, outputs on the right.
And moving between the two does slow you down a little, but that's ok.
