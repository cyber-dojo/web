Made kata_file_create/delete/rename live.
Tried kata_file_create with an edit to the initial readme.txt file.
Saver successfully adds the create-file event
but not the preceeding edit-file event.

Problem was missing cd.saveCodeFromSyntaxHighlightEditors();

Now the events.json shows the expected initial index=1 edit-file event.
But there is no event for create-file.
log of saver shows...

files does contain newfile.txt
